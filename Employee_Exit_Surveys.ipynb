    "## Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys \n",
    " >In this project, we will work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. We want to investigate the reasons why some groups of workers are resigning. Our aim to answer two main questions:    <br> 1) Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? <br>2) Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?"
